  Microentrepreneurship has grown in the world in recent times, this happens because of times of eco-
nomic crisis and unemployment, but also the emergence of new markets and opportunities. In Brazil,
most micro-entrepreneurs are merchants and service providers who do not know about marketing and
digital dissemination, something currently essential for the growth and prosperity of a business and
social networks as a form of dissemination and communication and in the influence of the media in the
purchase decision by consumers. The purpose of this project of technologies
applied to the development of an application for easy-to-use mobile devices aimed at promoting small
businesses, expanding the reach to new customers, and help to boost revenue. The result reached at
the end of this research was the elaboration of GeoBairros, which is a software developed in the Javas-
cript language, which makes it possible, from a register, to disclose and find service providers closest
to the user's location.
